{"role": "assistant", "content": "Creating a new Git branch is a straightforward process. Here\u2019s how you can do it using the command line:\n\n### Steps to Create a New Branch\n\n1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**\n\n2. **Navigate to your Git repository:**\n   Use the `cd` command to change the directory to your Git repository folder. For example:\n   ```bash\n   cd path/to/your/repository\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the current branch (optional):**\n   Before you create a new branch, you might want to check which branch you are currently on. You can do this with:\n   ```bash\n   git branch\n   ```\n\n4. **Create a new branch:**\n   You can create a new branch using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   git branch <new-branch-name>\n   ```\n   Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name you want for your new branch. For example:\n   ```bash\n   git branch feature/my-new-feature\n   ```\n\n5. **Switch to the new branch:**\n   After creating the branch, you need to switch to it using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout <new-branch-name>\n   ```\n   Alternatively, you can combine the branch creation and checkout into a single command:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>\n   ```\n   For example:\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify that you are on the new branch:**\n   You can confirm that you have successfully switched to the new branch by running:\n   ```bash\n   git branch\n   ```\n\n### Summary of Commands\nHere's a quick summary of the commands:\n```bash\ncd path/to/your/repository\ngit branch                    # Lists all branches\ngit branch <new-branch-name>  # Creates a new branch\ngit checkout <new-branch-name> # Switches to the new branch\n# OR\ngit checkout -b <new-branch-name> # Create and switch in one command\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n- Make sure you are on a clean working directory (i.e., your changes are committed) when switching branches to avoid complications.\n- Naming conventions for branches can help organize your work (like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, etc.).\n\nThat\u2019s it! You\u2019ve successfully created a new Git branch."}
