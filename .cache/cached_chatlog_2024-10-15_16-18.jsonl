{"role": "user", "content": "1Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved a milestone breakthrough and demonstrated impressive abilities in various applications (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023). However, it has been widely observed that even the state-of-the-art LLMs often make factually incorrect or nonsense generations (Cohen et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2022; Kuhn et al., 2022), which is also known as knowledge hallucination (Ji et al., 2023). The potentially unreliable generations make it risky to deploy LLMs in practical scenarios. Therefore, hallucination detection, that is, accurately detecting and rejecting responses when hallucinations occur in LLMs, has attracted more and more attention from the academic community (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023; Ren et al., 2022; Kuhn et al., 2022).\n\nThe token-level uncertainty estimation (e.g., predictive confidence or entropy) has shown its efficacy in hallucination detection on conventional NLP tasks (Malinin & Gales, 2020; Huang et al., 2023). However, how to derive the sentence-level uncertainty from the token-level remains a challenge, especially for modern auto-regressive LLMs whose response contents are generally diverse and sophisticated (Malinin & Gales, 2020; Kuhn et al., 2022; Duan et al., 2023). Thus, to avoid complicated token-to-sentence uncertainty derivation, researchers propose to evaluate the sentence uncertainty by the output languages directly (Kadavath et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Among the recent advancements, prompting LLMs to generate multiple responses to the same question and evaluating the self-consistency of those responses has been proven effective in hallucination detection (Wang et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022). However, such a post-hoc semantic measurement on decoded language sentences is inferior to precisely modeling the logical consistency/divergence Manakul et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023).\n\nHence, instead of logit-level or language-level uncertainty estimation, this paper proposes to leverage the internal states of LLMs to conduct hallucination detection. The motivation is intuitive: LLMs preserve the highly-concentrated semantic information of the entire sentence within their internal states (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023), allowing for the direct detection of hallucinated responses in the sentence embedding space.\n\nIn particular, with the generalized framework of INternal States for hallucInation DEtection (INSIDE), this paper performs hallucination detection from two perspectives. First, skipping secondary semantic extraction via extra models, we directly measure the self-consistency/divergence of the output sentences using internal states of LLMs. In order to explore semantic consistency in the embedding space, Section 3.1 introduces an EigenScore metric regarding the eigenvalues of sentence embeddings\u2019 covariance matrix. Second, to handle the self-consistent (overconfident) hallucinations, we propose to rectify abnormal activations of the internal states. Specifically, Section 3.2 develops a feature clipping approach to truncate extreme features, which tends to prevent overconfident generations during the auto-regressive procedure. In Section 4, the effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on several well-established QA benchmarks.\n\nThe main contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We propose a generalized INSIDE framework that leverages the internal states of LLMs to perform hallucination detection.\n\u2022 We develop an EigenScore metric to measure the semantic consistency in the embedding space, and demonstrate that the proposed EigenScore represents the differential entropy in the sentence embedding space.\n\u2022 A test time feature clipping approach is introduced to truncate extreme activations in the feature space, which implicitly reduces overconfident generations and helps identify the overconfident hallucinations.\n\u2022 We achieve state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance on several QA benchmarks, and conduct extensive ablation studies to verify the efficacy of our method.\n2Background on Hallucination Detection\nIn this work, we mainly focus on the knowledge hallucination detection of natural language generation based on LLMs, especially for Q&A task (Reddy et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). Given an input context \n\ud835\udc99\n, a typical LLM (Zhang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a) parameterized with \n\ud835\udf3d\n is able to generate output sequences in autoregressive manner \ny\nt\n=\nf\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udc99\n,\ny\n1\n,\ny\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\ny\nt\n\u2212\n1\n|\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n, where \n\ud835\udc9a\n=\n[\ny\n1\n,\ny\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\ny\nT\n]\n denotes the output sequence and \ny\nt\n denotes the t-\nt\n\u200b\nh\n output token. We denote \np\n\u200b\n(\ny\nt\n|\ny\n<\nt\n,\n\ud835\udc99\n)\n the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) of \nt\n-th token. For a traditional classification model, the MSP measures the confidence level of the classification result and has been widely used as an uncertainty measure of predictions (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016). Therefore, for sequence generation task, a straightforward sequence uncertainty can be defined as the joint probability of different tokens, which is known as Perplexity (Ren et al., 2022),\n\nP\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udc9a\n|\n\ud835\udc99\n,\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n=\n\u2212\n1\nT\n\u200b\nlog\n\u200b\n\u220f\nt\np\n\u200b\n(\ny\nt\n|\ny\n<\nt\n,\n\ud835\udc99\n)\n=\n\u2212\n1\nT\n\u200b\n\u2211\nt\nlog\n\u2061\np\n\u200b\n(\ny\nt\n|\ny\n<\nt\n,\n\ud835\udc99\n)\n(1)\nAs shorter sequences generally have lower perplexity, the length of the output sequence \nT\n is utilized to normalize the joint probability. Since different tokens contribute differently to the semantics of the sentence (Raj et al., 2023; Duan et al., 2023), the perplexity defined by averaging token-level uncertainty cannot effectively capture the uncertainty of the entire sequence. It has been demonstrated that utilizing multiple generations for one input is beneficial to estimate the sequence-level uncertainty (Malinin & Gales, 2020; Kuhn et al., 2022; Manakul et al., 2023). We denote \n\ud835\udcb4\n=\n[\n\ud835\udc9a\n1\n,\n\ud835\udc9a\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\ud835\udc9a\nK\n]\n as \nK\n generated responses for input context \n\ud835\udc99\n. For a given LLM, multiple responses could be easily obtained by the top-p/top-k sampling strategy during inference time (Touvron et al., 2023a; Kadavath et al., 2022). In Malinin & Gales (2020), the Length Normalized Entropy is proposed to measure the sequence-level uncertainty by making use of multiple generations, which is defined as\n\nH\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udcb4\n|\n\ud835\udc99\n,\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n=\n\u2212\n\ud835\udd3c\n\ud835\udc9a\n\u2208\n\ud835\udcb4\n\u200b\n1\nT\n\ud835\udc9a\n\u200b\n\u2211\nt\nlog\n\u2061\np\n\u200b\n(\ny\nt\n|\ny\n<\nt\n,\n\ud835\udc99\n)\n(2)\nWhen a model is uncertain about its response, it generates hallucination context, resulting in an answer distribution with a high entropy (Kadavath et al., 2022). It has been shown that the length-normalized entropy performs better than the non-normalized one (Lin et al., 2023).\n\nIn addition to the predictive uncertainty or entropy, the semantic consistency (Lin et al., 2023; Raj et al., 2023) among multiple responses has also been widely explored to measure the hallucination degree of LLMs, which hypothesis that the LLMs are expected to generate similar outputs if they know the input context and they are sure about the answers (Wang et al., 2022; Manakul et al., 2023). An intuitive semantic consistency metric is Lexical Similarity (Lin et al., 2022; 2023), which explores the average similarity across multiple answers as consistency measure\n\nS\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udcb4\n|\n\ud835\udc99\n,\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n=\n1\nC\n\u200b\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\nK\n\u2211\nj\n=\ni\n+\n1\nK\ns\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nm\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udc9a\ni\n,\n\ud835\udc9a\nj\n)\n(3)\nwhere \nC\n=\nK\n\u22c5\n(\nK\n\u2212\n1\n)\n/\n2\n and \ns\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nm\n\u200b\n(\n\u22c5\n,\n\u22c5\n)\n is the similarity defined by Rouge-L Lin (2004).\n\n3Method\nRefer to caption\nFigure 1:Illustration of our proposed hallucination detection pipeline. During inference time, for a given question, the extreme features in the penultimate layer are truncated and the EigenScore is computed based on the sentence embeddings across multiple responses.\nIn this section, we introduce the details of our proposed INSIDE framework for hallucination detection. The whole pipeline is illustrated as Fig. 1. In section 3.1, we demonstrate a simple but effective EigenScore metric by exploring sentence-level semantics in the internal states of LLMs. In section 3.2, a test-time feature clipping approach is introduced to effectively alleviate the issue of overconfident generation, thereby aiding in the identification of self-consistent hallucinations\n\n3.1Hallucination Detection by EigenScore\nThe existing uncertainty or consistency based hallucination detection metrics are exploited in the logit or language space, which neglect the dense semantic information that is retained within the internal states of LLMs. To better exploit the dense semantic information, we propose to measure the semantic divergence in the sentence embedding space. For the \nt\n-th output token \ny\nt\n, we denote the hidden embedding in the \nl\n-th layer as \n\ud835\udc89\nt\nl\n\u2208\n\u211d\nd\n, where \nd\n is the dimension of the hidden embedding (\nd\n=\n4096\n for LLaMA-7B and \nd\n=\n5120\n for LLaMA-13B). According to Ren et al. (2022); Azaria & Mitchell (2023), the sentence embedding can be obtained by averaging the token embedding \n\ud835\udc9b\n=\n1\nT\n\u200b\n\u2211\nt\n=\n1\nT\n\ud835\udc89\nt\n, or taking the last token embedding as sentence embedding \n\ud835\udc9b\n=\n\ud835\udc89\nT\n. In our main experiments, we use the embedding of the last token in the middle layer as the sentence embedding, as it effectively captures the sentence semantic (Azaria & Mitchell, 2023). The comparison results of using different sentence embeddings are demonstrated in the ablation studies 4.3. For \nK\n generated sequences, the covariance matrix of \nK\n sentence embeddings can be computed as\n\n\ud835\udeba\n=\n\ud835\udc19\n\u22a4\n\u22c5\n\ud835\udc09\nd\n\u22c5\n\ud835\udc19\n(4)\nwhere \n\ud835\udeba\n\u2208\n\u211d\nK\n\u00d7\nK\n represents the covariance matrix that captures the relationship between different sentences in the embedding space, \n\ud835\udc19\n=\n[\n\ud835\udc9b\n1\n,\n\ud835\udc9b\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\ud835\udc9b\nK\n]\n\u2208\n\u211d\nd\n\u00d7\nK\n represents the embedding matrix of different sentences, \n\ud835\udc09\nd\n=\n\ud835\udc70\nd\n\u2212\n1\nd\n\u200b\n\ud835\udfcf\nK\n\u200b\n\ud835\udfcf\nK\n\u22a4\n is the centering matrix and \n\ud835\udfcf\nK\n\u2208\n\u211d\nK\n is the all-one column vector. Then, the proposed EigenScore can be defined as the logarithm determinant (LogDet) of the covariance matrix,\n\nE\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udcb4\n|\n\ud835\udc99\n,\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n=\n1\nK\n\u200b\nlog\n\u2061\ndet\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udeba\n+\n\u03b1\n\u22c5\n\ud835\udc08\nK\n)\n(5)\nHere, \ndet\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udc17\n)\n represents the determinant of matrix \n\ud835\udc17\n, and a small regularization term \n\u03b1\n\u22c5\n\ud835\udc08\nK\n is added to the covariance matrix to explicitly make it full rank. Since the matrix determinant can be obtained by solving the eigenvalues, the EigenScore can be computed as\n\nE\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udcb4\n|\n\ud835\udc99\n,\n\ud835\udf3d\n)\n=\n1\nK\n\u200b\nlog\n\u2061\n(\n\u220f\ni\n\u03bb\ni\n)\n=\n1\nK\n\u200b\n\u2211\ni\nK\nlog\n\u2061\n(\n\u03bb\ni\n)\n(6)\nwhere \n\u03bb\n=\n{\n\u03bb\n1\n,\n\u03bb\n2\n,\n\u22ef\n,\n\u03bb\nK\n}\n denotes the eigenvalues of the regularized covariance matrix \n\ud835\udeba\n+\n\u03b1\n\u22c5\n\ud835\udc08\n, which can be solved by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Eq. 6 shows that the hallucination degree of LLM\u2019s generation can be measured by the average logarithm of the eigenvalues. The conclusion is intuitive, as the eigenvalues of covariance matrix capture the divergence and correlation relationship between embeddings of different sentences. When the LLM is confident to the answers and \nK\n generations have similar semantic, the sentence embeddings will be highly correlated and most eigenvalues will be close to 0. On the contrary, when the LLM is indecisive and hallucinating contents, the model will generate multiple sentences with diverse semantics leading to more significant eigenvalues. The following remark is also provided to explain why the proposed EigenScore is a good measure of knowledge hallucination.\n\nRemark 1. LogDet of covariance matrix represents the differential entropy in the sentence embedding space. Differential Entropy is the natural extension of discrete Shannon Entropy \nH\ne\n\u200b\n(\nX\n)\n=\n\u2212\n\u2211\nX\n\u2212\np\n\u200b\n(\nx\n)\n\u200b\nlog\n\u2061\np\n\u200b\n(\nx\n)\n. The differential entropy \nH\nd\n\u200b\ne\n\u200b\n(\nX\n)\n in continuous space can be defined by replacing the probability function with its density function \nf\n\u200b\n(\nx\n)\n and integrating over \nx\n, i.e., \nH\nd\n\u200b\ne\n\u200b\n(\nX\n)\n=\n\u2212\n\u222b\nx\nf\n\u200b\n(\nx\n)\n\u200b\nlog\n\u2061\nf\n\u200b\n(\nx\n)\n\u200b\n\ud835\udc51\nx\n. In principle (Zhouyin & Liu, 2021), for a multivariate Gaussian distribution \nX\n\u223c\nN\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udf41\n,\n\ud835\udeba\n)\n, the differential entropy can be represented as\n\nH\nd\n\u200b\ne\n\u200b\n(\nX\n)\n=\n1\n2\n\u200b\nlog\n\u2061\ndet\n\u200b\n(\n\ud835\udeba\n)\n+\nd\n2\n\u200b\n(\nlog\n\u2061\n2\n\u200b\n\u03c0\n+\n1\n)\n=\n1\n2\n\u200b\n\u2211\ni\n=\n1\nd\nlog\n\u2061\n\u03bb\ni\n+\nC\n(7)\nwhere \nd\n is the dimension of variables and \nC\n is a constant. Therefore, the differential entropy is determined by the eigenvalues (LogDet) of the covariance matrix.\n\nAccording to Remark 1, the proposed EigenScore defined by Eq. 6 represents the differential entropy in the sentence embedding space, which offers valuable insight into using EigenScore as a semantic divergence measure. Compared to existing uncertainty or consistency metrics that obtained in logit or language space (Malinin & Gales, 2020; Huang et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2022), the advantages of EigenScore are: (1) It captures the semantic divergence (entropy) in the dense embedding space, which is expected to retain highly-concentrated semantic information compared to logits or languages (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019). (2) Representing semantic divergence in embedding space can effectively solve the semantic equivalence (linguistic invariances) problem (Kuhn et al., 2022) in natural language space. (3) Fine-grained semantic relationship among different responses can be exploited by using eigenvalues of covariance matrix. Therefore, through the exploration of dense semantic information in the internal states, the EigenScore is expected to outperform existing uncertainty and consistency metrics, resulting in improved hallucination detection performance.\n\nRefer to caption\n(a)Neuron Activation\nRefer to caption\n(b)Feature Distribution\nFigure 2:Illustration of activation distributions in the penultimate layer of LLaMA-7B. (a) Activation distribution in the penultimate layer for a randomly sampled token. (b) Activation distribution for a randomly sampled neuron activation of numerous tokens.\n3.2Test Time Feature Clipping\nRecent works have shown that the LLMs are subject to the risks of self-consistent (overconfident) hallucinations (Ren et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2023), which has not been considered by existing consistency based methods. Therefore, to address those common failure cases caused by overconfident generation, a test time feature clipping approach is introduced during the computation of EigenScore. As shown in Figure. 2, we illustrate the activation distribution in the penultimate layer of LLaMA-7B. An intuitive observation is that the penultimate layer of LLMs tends to exhibit numerous extreme features, consequently increasing the likelihood of generating overconfident and self-consistent generations. Inspired by prior works that rectify internal activations to reduce overconfident prediction for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection (Sun et al., 2021; Djurisic et al., 2022), we introduce a test time feature clipping (FC) method to prevent LLMs generate overconfident hallucinations. To rectify those extreme features, the FC operation is defined as the following piecewise function\n\nF\n\u200b\nC\n\u200b\n(\nh\n)\n=\n{\nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\n,\nh\n<\nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\nh\n,\nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\n\u2264\nh\n\u2264\nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\nh\n>\nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\n(8)\nwhere \nh\n represents the feature of the hidden embeddings in the penultimate layer of the LLMs, \nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\n and \nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\n are two thresholds for determining the minimum and maximum truncation activations. When \nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\n=\n\u2212\n\u221e\n and \nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\n=\n+\n\u221e\n, the output feature embedding is equivalent to the original output. For the determination of the optimal truncation thresholds, a memory bank which dynamically pushes and pops element in it, is utilized to conserve \nN\n token embeddings during test time. Then, for each hidden neuron, the thresholds \nh\nm\n\u200b\ni\n\u200b\nn\n and \nh\nm\n\u200b\na\n\u200b\nx\n are set to the top and bottom \np\n-th percentiles of the features in the memory bank. Refer to the three-sigma-rule Pukelsheim (1994), we set \np\n=\n0.2\n in all cases. This implies that the activations falling within the largest and smallest top 0.2% in the memory bank are identified as abnormal features and subsequently truncated for reducing overconfident generation.\n\n4Experiments\n4.1Experimental Setup\nDatasets. We utilize four widely used question answering (QA) datasets for evaluation, including two open-book conversational QA datasets CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019) and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), as well as two closed-book QA datasets TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) and Natural Questions (NQ) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). We follow Lin et al. (2023) to utilize the development split of CoQA with 7983 QA pairs, the validation split of NQ with 3610 QA pairs and the validation split of the TriviaQA (rc.nocontext subset) with 9,960 deduplicated QA pairs. For the SQuAD dataset, we filter out the QA pairs with their flag is_impossible = True, and utilize the subset of the development-v2.0 split with 5928 QA pairs. The lengths of the sequences vary in the four datasets. Specifically, the ground truth answers in CoQA and SQuAD are relatively longer, while and TriviaQA typically consists of answers that are only with one or two words.\n\nModels. We use two representative open source LLMs, including LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a) and OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) in our experiments. Specifically, we consider off-the-shelf LLaMA-7B 1\n1\nhttps://huggingface.co/decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf\n, LLaMA-13B 2\n2\nhttps://huggingface.co/decapoda-research/llama-13b-hf\n, OPT-6.7B 3\n3\nhttps://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-6.7b\n and their corresponding tokenizer provided by Hugging Face 4\n4\nhttps://huggingface.co/\n. We use the pre-trained wights and do not finetune these models in all cases.\n\nEvaluation Metrics. Following prior work Kuhn et al. (2022); Ren et al. (2022), we evaluate the hallucination detection ability of different methods by employing them to determine whether the generation is correct or not. Therefore, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) are utilized as the performance measure. AUROC is a popular metric to evaluate the quality of a binary classifier and uncertainty measure (Ren et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023). Higher AUROC scores are better. PCC is utilized to measure the correlation between the hallucination detection metric and the correctness measure, which is usually defined as the ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) or semantic similarity (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) between the generated answers and ground truth answers. A higher PCC score is better.\n\nBaselines. We compare our proposal with the most popular uncertainty-based methods Perplexity Ren et al. (2022) and Length-normalized Entropy (LN-Entropy) Malinin & Gales (2020), and the consistency-based metric Lexical Similarity (Lin et al., 2022). Besides, in order to investigate whether traditional OOD detection methods can be used for hallucination detection, we also introduce a popular OOD detection method Energy score (Liu et al., 2020) as a comparison method.\n\nCorrectness Measure. We follow Kuhn et al. (2022); Lin et al. (2023) to utilize both the ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) and the semantic similarity (Reimers & Gurevych, 2019) as the correctness measure. ROUGE-L 5\n5\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/rouge\n is an n-gram based metric that computes the longest common subsequence between two pieces of text. The generation is regarded as correct when the ROUGE-L (f-measure) is large than a given threshold, which we set to 0.5 in our main experiments. Besides, we also use the embedding similarity as the correctness measure. The sentence embeddings of model generation and the ground truth answer are extracted by the nli-roberta-large model 6\n6\nhttps://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/nli-roberta-large\n, and the generation is regarded as true when the cosine similarity between two embeddings is larger than 0.9.\n\nImplementation Details. Implementation of this work is based on pytorch and transformers libraries. For the hyperparameters that are used for sampling strategies of LLMs\u2019 decoder, we set temperature to 0.5, top-p to 0.99 and top-k to 5 through the experiments. The number of generations is set to \nK\n=\n10\n. For the sentence embedding used in our proposal, we use the last token embedding of the sentence in the middle layer, i.e., the layer index is set to int(L/2). For the regularization term of the covariance matrix, we set \n\u03b1\n=\n0.001\n. For the memory bank used to conserve token embeddings, we set \nN\n=\n3000\n. When implement the Energy Score, we average the token-level energy score as the sentence-level energy score.\n\n\nRead the given paper and implement the main experiments in Python."}

Additional Considerations\n\n### 8.1. Handling Memory Bank for Feature Clipping\n\nThe `feature_clipping` function maintains a memory bank to dynamically set clipping thresholds. Ensure this memory bank persists across samples and is appropriately updated.\n\n### 8.2. Correctness Labels\n\nThe implementation assumes a simple correctness labeling based on ROUGE-L scores. Depending on the dataset and specific requirements, you might need a more sophisticated method to assign labels indicating whether a response is hallucinated.\n\n### 8.3. Performance Optimization\n\nGenerating multiple responses and processing large models can be time-consuming. Consider optimizing the generation process, utilizing batch processing, or distributing the workload across multiple GPUs if available.\n\n### 8.4. Evaluation Metrics Alignment\n\nEnsure that the evaluation metrics align with the definitions provided in the paper. Adjust the labeling and metric computations as necessary to reflect the ground truth and the specific hallucination detection objectives.\n\n## 9. Conclusion\n\nThis implementation provides a structured approach to replicating the main experiments outlined in the provided paper on hallucination detection in LLMs. By leveraging internal states and computing the EigenScore, along with baseline metrics, this pipeline facilitates comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and datasets.\n\n**Final Note:** Depending on the specific details and nuances of the original paper, you might need to adjust certain components, such as the exact method for extracting sentence embeddings, the labeling strategy, or the handling of specific datasets. Always refer to the original paper for precise methodological guidelines and ensure compliance with licensing and usage restrictions of the models and datasets used."}
